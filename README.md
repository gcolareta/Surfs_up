## Overview
This weather analysis will be included in a business plan report presented to investors.
The business is a Surf Shop, offering surf boards and shakes, in the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
In this analysis we are observing temperature data for the months of June and December to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

- The average temperature for June  and December are 75 and 71 degrees Fahrenheit respectively. Not too far apart for summer and winter months.
- The minimum temperature for June is 64 degrees while the lowest in December could get to 56 degrees.
- The maximum temperature registered in June is 85 degrees, not too far from the high in December which is  83 degrees.

## Summary
Based on temperature alone for June and December, it seems as if surf could be sustained year-round. The difference between the low temperatures between summer and winter could discourage some tourists, but nothing that a thick wetsuit can't fix. However, since for most of Hawaii, there are only two seasons: "summer," between May and October, and "winter," between October and April, one factor to consider for further analysis would be to study the months of winter to determine the lowest temperatures of the season and have a more accurate report.

Another important factor to consider for this report is that Hawaii has a Humid Tropical Climate, which means that is one of only a few places in the world with peak rainfall during winter months. This fact makes it important to study precipitation during winter months in the island of Oahu.
